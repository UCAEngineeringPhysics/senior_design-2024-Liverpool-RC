## Ethan Durham:
### This Week:
- I drilled holes into our base for the Pi to be placed in.
- I 3d printed a pi camera mount to place onto our base.
- I 3d printed a new switch case.
- I soldered wires to our new switch and placed it into the switch case. 

### Future Goals:
- Start a third design iteration.
- Place all outside components, pi camera and pi, onto the base
- Make sure everything is connected, so we can have a drivable robot.
- Screw drill holes for second wire splitter
