### This Week:
- I have been researching how opencv works.
- Been having trouble opening opencv so started to reinstall opencv.
### Goals:
- I want to be able to get opencv working, so we can continue onto the next step of getting slam figured out. 

## Kajsa Pruner
### This Week:
- I have been traveling with soccer for the past week, so I have not been able to do much
- Created the Power Point for Friday
- Decided that we want a metal bracket for putting together the two base boards.
### Future Goals
- Draw a holder for the battery that will hold the battery in place, 3D print this.

### This Week:
- I have completed a second design iteration for the new base.
- I pushed the rear wheel mounts forward, cut the thickness of the base in half, and I cut a hole through the base to allow a path for wires. 
- I want to have the new base put together so that I can show it off during the presentation.
- Made the decision to scrap the slide idea for combining the bases. Using Kajsa's idea, we have switched back to using brackets to combine the two parts together. 
### Future Goals:
- I want to have design2 completed and in one piece.
- I want to start transferring the components from old Virgil to new Virgil.
- I want to start a third (final?) design iteration with pre-drilled holes for screws and other additional pieces, like the switch case, battery holder, and camera mount.
