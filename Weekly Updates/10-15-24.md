## Kajsa Pruner
### This week
- did research on how we can write code for camera to detect objects

### Future Goals
- Continue to do research about packages and code we need to get all the functions together (camera, motordriver etc). I specifically want to get better at Visual SLAM because I think this will be crucial for us.
- Do more research on visual SLAM, the mapping and localization.
- FYI. I will be traveling the rest of the week to Florida so will not be in Conway much this week.
