### This week
- Did some research on Visual SLAM (ORB SLAM). The mapping and Localization. Have not been able to do that much, but will continue next week.
- Printed switch case

### Future Goals
- Continue to do research about packages and code we need to get all the functions together (camera, motordriver etc). I specifically want to get better at Visual SLAM because I think this will be crucial for us.
- Do more research on visual SLAM, the mapping and localization.
- FYI. I will be traveling the rest of the week to Florida so will not be in Conway much this week. will be taking a webcamera with me to florida so I can deep diver with the camera and ORB SLAM2 in USL on my computer.
