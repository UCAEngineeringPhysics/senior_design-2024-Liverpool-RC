### This Week:
- I assisted Kajsa in the printing of the battery holder.
- I unmounted all of the components from Old Virgil.
- I created a rough draft on where I want the components to go on New Virgil. ![IMG_4043](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a012567-4b82-43d9-a71d-8e3ca80a2a50)
- I measured out holes for the brackets that mount the wheels.
### Future Goals:
- I want to start a new design iteration that includes pre-drilled screw holes and some other changes (that I have not thought of yet).
- I want to have a robot base that is drivable within the next couple of weeks.
