This week I created this respitory in Github so that we can have somewhere to publish all our work, code and weekly updates. Our first class we had together we discussed when we will meet
and we decided to meet every tuesday at 1:30 until about 4pm, depending on how much we will get done and how much we have to do. Additionally we talked about maybe meeting one more day each week 
but this will be decided the week of since we all have busy schedules. I also helped to find screws to the new wheels that we got for our robot to we could attach them.

This week, I researched the Jetson Orin Nano and installed a new hard drive, successfully flashing the latest OS onto it. I also set up the system for future use. Additionally, I retrieved the wheel driver code from the Pico and modified the main loop to enable the robot to move forward and backward.

This week I was introduced to Virgil and the Liverpool-RC project. I assisted in troubleshooting and attaching the new wheels and tires onto the robot. I am beginning to research CAD
design, and trying to learn how to navigate these types of software. I want to begin to create a new compact design for Virgil for the future competitions.
