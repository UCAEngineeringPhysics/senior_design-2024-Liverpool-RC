This week I created this respitory in Github so that we can have somewhere to publish all our work, code and weekly updates. Our first class we had together we discussed when we will meet
and we decided to meet every tuesday at 1:30 until about 4pm, depending on how much we will get done and how much we have to do. Additionally we talked about maybe meeting one more day each week 
but this will be decided the week of since we all have busy schedules. I also helped to find screws to the new wheels that we got for our robot to we could attach them.
